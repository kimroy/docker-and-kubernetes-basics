To build our own image we will use Dockerfiles.
-> A Dockerfile is a plain text file with configuration which defines how our container behave on startup.
-> Dockerfiles are then passed to the Docker Client.
-> The Docker Client provides the file to the Docker Server
-> Takes the Dockerfile and the Docker Server creates the image from that configuration.

Dockerfile Flow:
1. Specify a base image
2. Run some commands to install additional programs
3. Specify a command to run on container startup
